# TheBridgeSolution
A solution for "The Bridge" problem in codeingames

## The problem
There is 1-4 bikes on a track. The track has either roads or holes. At least one bike needs to make it to the end. You can only give one command to all bikes each round. This is a display of backtracking and DFS. 

## The solution
I created a a recursive function that simulated all possible moves prioritizing speeding up and jumping. I think wrote a function for validating each set of moves to see if the outcome would be success or failure. I didn't rate the different outcomes, first solution resulting in success for the next 6 moves would be choosen.
